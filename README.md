Reflection: 3D Desk Scene Project
How do I approach designing software?

This project helped me improve my spatial and visual design skills. I built the scene from the ground upâ€”starting with the desk and adding objects like a computer, lamp, and book. I focused on layout, color, and lighting to create a realistic 3D workspace. These design strategies will help me plan and build clearer projects in the future.
How do I approach developing programs?

I used modular coding and iterative testing to build the scene step by step. I frequently tested changes, fixed rendering issues, and improved object placement and lighting. My coding approach evolved to be more structured and efficient, especially with reusable functions and camera controls.
How can computer science help me reach my goals?

This project gave me hands-on experience with OpenGL, transformations, lighting, and textures. These skills are a strong foundation for future work in graphics, game development, or simulations. It also improved my overall programming confidence and problem-solving skills.
